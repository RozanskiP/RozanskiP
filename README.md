# Hello I'm Pawel Rozanski

I am a student of Computer Engineering with a specialization in Computer Graphics and Multimedia Systems at the Wrocław University of Technology. Currently I am finishing fifth year of my studies. For more than 2 years I have been working as a full-stack software developer in dotnet and angular technologies. Also I have some experience in programming languages such as Python, but I'm have focused on developing my skills in web technologies for over a year from now.
