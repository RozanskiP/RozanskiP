# Hello I'm Pawel Rozanski

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology in June 2024. Currently, I work as a Full Stack Software Developer at a multinational company specializing in self-storage software solutions. In this role, I am fully responsible for maintaining and enhancing the system across all layers.

Outside of my primary role, I actively contribute to a side project focused on aggregating public sector job listings and delivering recruitment solutions. I design and maintain scalable web scraping tools to automate data collection from various official sources, continuously optimizing performance and data accuracy.

I specialize in .NET and Angular, and I am passionate about artificial intelligence. I actively seek opportunities to grow in this field by exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest developments.
